# PowerShell Reliability Framework (PRF)

> Reliable PowerShell generation for AI agents — AI Agent Infrastructure / Windows Automation Reliability Layer
>
> v0.1.0 Skill Package (Part I of the planning proposal: Skill-based Reliability Layer)

[中文说明](docs/README.zh-CN.md)

PRF is not a tutorial, not a code generator, and not a Copilot prompt. It is a
**reliability layer** for AI coding agents: any agent that supports Agent Skills
loads PRF by default *before* generating / reviewing / executing PowerShell,
turning the flow from "LLM → script → pray" into:

```text
Probe → Classify(R/W/D/N/C) → Draft → Rule Check → Propose(-WhatIf) → Confirm → Execute → Verify → Report
```

## Quick start

1. **Hook it into your agent**: hand this directory to your agent's skill loader
   (the entry point is `SKILL.md`).
   - Claude Code / Cursor-style agents: drop it into their skills directory.
   - DeepSeek Harness (DSH): copy to `${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}/.agent-presets/<preset>/skills/`
     or reference it from your preset composition.
2. Instruct the agent: *"Load the powershell-reliability-framework skill before any
   PowerShell work."*
3. Validate package integrity anytime:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/validate.py        # L0 gate
   python3 tools/rule-selftest.py   # L1 gate
   ```

4. Probe a target machine before generating anything against it:

   ```powershell
   pwsh -File tools/probe-environment.ps1 -AsJson   # or powershell.exe
   ```

## Rule schema

Each rule in `rules/reliability-rules.yaml` carries: `id · category · severity · title · description · bad · good · rationale · applies_to · tags · detection{pattern, psscriptanalyzer}`.
36 of 100 rules currently include detection hints (`detection_rule_count` in the YAML header); coverage grows with v0.2 static-analysis integration.

## Roadmap

| Version | Goal | Status |
|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0 | Skill-based Reliability Layer | ✅ this repository (alpha) |
| v0.2.0 | Static Analysis Integration (PSScriptAnalyzer + custom PRF rules) | `detection.psscriptanalyzer` field reserved |
| v0.3.0 | Sandbox Execution (Windows Sandbox / Hyper-V runner) | — |
| v0.4.0 | Enterprise Policy Engine (admission-controller style deny/audit/approve) | — |
| v0.5.0 | Multi-Agent Architecture (Planner/Engineer/Reviewer/Executor) | — |
| v1.0 | PowerShell Agent Runtime | Vision |

## Success metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|---|---:|---:|
| Benchmark cases | 100 | 100 ✅ |
| Rules | 100+ | 100 |
| Knowledge docs | 5 | 5 |
| Example pairs | — | 10 |
| Agent support | 3+ | any Skills-capable agent (portable format) |

Measured effectiveness targets (A/B protocol in `docs/testing-plan.md`) are being
established; none are claimed until the first double-blind benchmark run completes.

## Safety notice

`examples/bad/` and security-rule snippets show *attack-shaped* PowerShell
(download-and-execute cradles, persistence patterns) **as negative training
examples only**. They are intentionally non-operational illustrations. Never
execute `examples/bad/*.ps1`. PRF is intended exclusively for defensive and
reliability-engineering purposes.
